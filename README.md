myPetsitterPro is a plateform linking professional petsitters and clients in order to simplify bookings, transactions, ...
</p>
<br>
<p>  
Petsitters are selected through a strict selection process that requires an intuitive dashboard to allow the process to go smoothly. Once the process is completed, petsitters can give all the informations needed for a booking (be it dates/hours or even dog categories that will be turned down,...)
</p>
<p> 
Clients can create an account for themselves as well as their pets, allowing them to keep their personal information and pets updated and not needing to fill it up for every booking.
</p>
<br>
Transactions are carried out with PayPal.
